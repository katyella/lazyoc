# Homebrew Tap Setup for LazyOC

## Steps to Enable Homebrew Installation

### 1. Create the Homebrew Tap Repository

You need to create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-tap` under your account:

```bash
# Create the repository on GitHub
gh repo create katyella/homebrew-tap --public --description "Homebrew tap for LazyOC"

# Clone locally to initialize
git clone https://github.com/katyella/homebrew-tap.git
cd homebrew-tap

# Create the Formula directory
mkdir -p Formula

# Create basic README
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# LazyOC Homebrew Tap

This is the Homebrew tap for [LazyOC](https://github.com/katyella/lazyoc), a lazy terminal UI for OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap katyella/tap
brew install lazyoc
```

## Updating

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade lazyoc
```
EOF

# Initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial tap setup"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Generate Your First Release

After creating the tap repository, create a new tag to trigger a release:

```bash
cd /path/to/lazyoc
git tag v0.1.1  # or whatever version is next
git push origin v0.1.1
```

This will:
- Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
- Build binaries for all platforms
- Create a GitHub release
- Generate and push the Homebrew formula to your tap

### 3. Test Installation

Once the release is complete, users can install with:

```bash
brew tap katyella/tap
brew install lazyoc
```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Token (if needed)

If you encounter permission issues, you may need to create a personal access token with `repo` permissions and add it as a repository secret named `GORELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Repository Structure After Setup

```
homebrew-tap/
├── README.md
└── Formula/
    └── lazyoc.rb  # Auto-generated by GoReleaser
```

## Usage Examples

After installation, users can run:

```bash
lazyoc --help
lazyoc --version
lazyoc --kubeconfig=/path/to/config
```
