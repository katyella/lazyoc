# Task ID: 5
# Title: Multi-Cluster Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement support for managing multiple OpenShift clusters with context switching and unified view.
# Details:
1. Create cluster context manager
2. Implement cluster switching UI
3. Add persistent cluster preferences
4. Create connection status indicators for each cluster
5. Implement parallel resource fetching from multiple clusters
6. Add cluster-aware resource operations
7. Create unified view for resources across clusters
8. Implement cluster grouping and filtering
9. Add cluster metadata display (version, health, API status)
10. Create cluster comparison views for resource distribution

# Test Strategy:
1. Test context switching between multiple clusters
2. Verify resource operations target the correct cluster
3. Test parallel operations across multiple clusters
4. Verify cluster preferences are correctly persisted
5. Test unified view with resources from different clusters
6. Verify performance with multiple active connections
7. Test error handling when clusters become unavailable

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Cluster Context Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a cluster context manager with switching capabilities and persistent storage for cluster configurations and preferences
### Details:
Implement a robust context management system that maintains active cluster connections, stores cluster configurations (API URLs, auth tokens, certificates), handles context switching without losing connection state, persists user preferences per cluster (default namespace, resource filters), and provides thread-safe access to cluster contexts. Include support for importing kubeconfig files and manual cluster addition.

## 2. Build Multi-Cluster Connection Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement connection management for multiple clusters with health monitoring, status indicators, and automatic reconnection capabilities
### Details:
Create a connection pool manager that maintains concurrent connections to multiple clusters, implements health checks and status monitoring for each cluster (API availability, auth validity, latency), provides visual status indicators in the UI, handles connection failures gracefully with exponential backoff retry logic, and manages authentication refresh for expiring tokens. Include connection pooling to optimize resource usage.

## 3. Develop Parallel Resource Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement parallel resource fetching and operations across multiple clusters with proper error handling and performance optimization
### Details:
Build a parallel execution framework using goroutines for concurrent resource operations, implement rate limiting to prevent API overload, create aggregation logic for combining results from multiple clusters, handle partial failures gracefully, and optimize performance through intelligent caching and batch operations. Include progress indicators for long-running operations and cancellation support.

## 4. Create Unified Views and Comparison Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement unified resource views across clusters with comparison capabilities, filtering, and cluster-aware visualizations
### Details:
Design and implement unified views that aggregate resources from all connected clusters, create cluster comparison views showing resource distribution and differences, implement cluster-aware filtering and grouping (by cluster, namespace, labels), add visual indicators for resource origin, and build cluster metadata displays showing version info, health status, and resource capacity. Include export functionality for multi-cluster reports.
