# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Plugin Architecture Design and Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the foundational plugin architecture with well-defined interfaces, lifecycle management, and extensibility patterns for LazyOC
### Details:
Design comprehensive plugin interfaces including: 1) Plugin manifest structure with metadata, version, and capability declarations, 2) Core plugin API interfaces for UI extension, resource management hooks, and event subscriptions, 3) Plugin lifecycle interfaces (install, enable, disable, uninstall, upgrade), 4) Extension point definitions for UI components, resource handlers, and custom actions, 5) Plugin context API for accessing LazyOC services, 6) Event bus architecture for plugin communication, 7) Configuration schema standards for plugin settings, 8) Error handling and logging interfaces, 9) Performance monitoring hooks for plugins

## 2. Sandboxed Execution Environment with Security Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement a secure sandboxed execution environment for plugins with comprehensive security controls and resource isolation
### Details:
Create sandboxed environment including: 1) JavaScript/WebAssembly sandbox using V8 isolates or similar technology, 2) Capability-based security model with fine-grained permissions, 3) Resource quotas (CPU, memory, API calls) per plugin, 4) Network access controls with allowlist/blocklist, 5) File system isolation and virtual file system for plugins, 6) Secure inter-plugin communication channels, 7) Runtime security monitoring and violation detection, 8) Plugin signature verification and integrity checking, 9) Audit logging for all plugin activities, 10) Graceful handling of malicious or misbehaving plugins

## 3. Plugin Dependency Management and Hot-Loading Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Implement plugin dependency resolution, version management, and hot-loading capabilities for seamless plugin updates
### Details:
Build dependency management system: 1) Semantic versioning support for plugins and LazyOC API, 2) Dependency graph resolution with conflict detection, 3) Plugin registry with version history tracking, 4) Hot-loading mechanism with state preservation, 5) Rollback support for failed updates, 6) Plugin compatibility matrix management, 7) Lazy loading for performance optimization, 8) Plugin bundling and asset management, 9) Development mode with auto-reload support, 10) Migration framework for plugin version upgrades

## 4. Plugin Marketplace Infrastructure with Discovery and Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create a plugin marketplace infrastructure enabling easy discovery, installation, and management of community plugins
### Details:
Develop marketplace features: 1) Plugin repository backend with metadata storage, 2) Search and discovery API with filtering capabilities, 3) Plugin installation workflow with dependency resolution, 4) Rating and review system for quality assurance, 5) Automated security scanning for submissions, 6) Developer portal for plugin submission, 7) Usage analytics and popularity tracking, 8) Update notifications and auto-update options, 9) Private plugin registry support for enterprises, 10) CLI and UI interfaces for marketplace interaction

## 5. Developer Documentation and Sample Plugins [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create comprehensive developer documentation and implement sample plugins demonstrating best practices and common integration patterns
### Details:
Produce developer resources: 1) Plugin development guide with architecture overview, 2) API reference documentation with examples, 3) Plugin development CLI tools and scaffolding, 4) Testing framework and utilities for plugin developers, 5) Sample plugins: Prometheus metrics exporter, Grafana dashboard integration, custom resource visualizer, CI/CD pipeline monitor, audit log exporter, 6) Best practices guide for security and performance, 7) Plugin submission guidelines and review process, 8) Troubleshooting guide and FAQ, 9) Video tutorials and workshop materials, 10) Community contribution guidelines
