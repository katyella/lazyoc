# Task ID: 3
# Title: OpenShift Client Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the OpenShift client libraries to enable communication with OpenShift clusters, including authentication and basic resource retrieval.
# Details:
1. Integrate client-go and openshift/client-go libraries
2. Implement connection pool with HTTP/2 support
3. Create authentication manager supporting:
   - kubeconfig file parsing
   - Service account tokens
   - OAuth token authentication
4. Implement automatic cluster context detection
5. Create rate limiter using token bucket algorithm
6. Implement error handling with retry logic
7. Add connection status monitoring
8. Create API client abstraction layer for resource operations
9. Implement metrics collection for API latency
10. Add support for multiple OpenShift versions (4.8+ primary, 3.11+ legacy)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for client functionality
2. Integration tests against mock OpenShift API
3. Test authentication with different credential types
4. Verify rate limiting and retry behavior
5. Test compatibility with different OpenShift versions
6. Benchmark API performance and latency
7. Test error handling with simulated failures
