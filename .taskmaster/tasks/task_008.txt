# Task ID: 8
# Title: Developer Workflow Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement developer-focused features including port forwarding, shell access, file transfer, and resource editing.
# Details:
1. Create port forwarding management with automatic tunnel setup
2. Implement container shell access with exec support
3. Add file transfer between local machine and containers
4. Create resource editing with YAML/JSON validation
5. Implement hot reload for configuration changes
6. Add development environment setup wizards
7. Create local-to-remote synchronization
8. Implement build and deployment triggers
9. Add debugging support with breakpoints
10. Create development workflow templates

# Test Strategy:
1. Test port forwarding with various service types
2. Verify shell access works across container types
3. Test file transfer performance and reliability
4. Verify resource editing with validation
5. Test hot reload functionality
6. Verify synchronization between local and remote
7. Test debugging features with sample applications

# Subtasks:
## 1. Port Forwarding System with Automatic Tunnel Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement automatic port forwarding for accessing services running in containers with intelligent tunnel lifecycle management
### Details:
Create a port forwarding manager that automatically establishes tunnels to container ports, handles connection failures with auto-reconnect, manages multiple concurrent tunnels, provides port collision detection and resolution, supports both TCP and UDP protocols, implements tunnel health monitoring, and creates a UI for managing active tunnels with start/stop controls

## 2. Container Shell Access and Exec Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement interactive shell access to containers with full exec support for running commands
### Details:
Build a terminal emulator component with PTY support, implement WebSocket-based shell streaming, add support for multiple shell types (bash, sh, PowerShell), create command history and auto-completion, implement file upload/download through shell, add session persistence and recovery, support for exec into specific containers in multi-container pods, and implement security controls for shell access

## 3. File Transfer and Synchronization Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create bidirectional file transfer capabilities between local machine and containers with real-time synchronization
### Details:
Implement drag-and-drop file upload to containers, create file browser for container filesystems, add bulk file transfer with progress tracking, implement directory synchronization with conflict resolution, create file watcher for automatic sync, add compression for large file transfers, implement resume capability for interrupted transfers, and create file diff viewer for comparing local and remote files

## 4. Resource Editing with YAML/JSON Validation and Hot Reload [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build advanced resource editor with syntax validation, schema support, and automatic hot reload on changes
### Details:
Create Monaco-based editor with YAML/JSON syntax highlighting, implement OpenShift resource schema validation, add intelligent auto-completion based on resource type, implement diff view for comparing changes, create hot reload system that applies changes without disruption, add rollback capability for failed updates, implement template support for common patterns, and create validation preview before applying changes

## 5. Development Environment Wizards and Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create guided wizards and templates for setting up development environments with best practices
### Details:
Build step-by-step wizards for common development scenarios, create project scaffolding templates, implement environment cloning functionality, add preset configurations for different tech stacks, create development workflow automation, implement environment health checks, add integration with popular IDEs, and create shareable environment configurations

## 6. Debugging Support with Breakpoint Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive debugging capabilities with breakpoint support and integration with development tools
### Details:
Create remote debugging protocol support, implement breakpoint management UI, add variable inspection and watch expressions, create call stack visualization, implement conditional breakpoints, add debugging session management, create integration with VS Code Debug Adapter Protocol, implement performance profiling tools, and add memory dump analysis capabilities
