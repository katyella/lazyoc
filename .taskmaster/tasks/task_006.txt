# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time log streaming from containers and event monitoring with filtering capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create log streaming component using API watch endpoints
2. Implement log filtering with regex support
3. Add timestamp filtering for logs
4. Create log highlighting and coloring based on content
