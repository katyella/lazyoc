		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into distinct phases: 1) Go project initialization with proper structure and dependencies, 2) GitHub Actions workflow configuration for CI/CD, 3) GoReleaser setup for cross-platform builds, and 4) Documentation and development environment setup. Each subtask should be independently completable with clear deliverables.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct components (Go setup, CI/CD, cross-platform builds, documentation) that can be parallelized. The existing 4 subtasks are well-structured and appropriately scoped. Complexity is moderate due to the need for proper configuration and testing across multiple platforms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Basic TUI Framework Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Bubble Tea framework integration and base application structure, 2) Layout system implementation with panels and responsive design, 3) Navigation system with vim-like keybindings and help overlay, 4) State management and event handling system, and 5) Theme/color scheme management with terminal capability detection. Focus on creating reusable components that will serve as the foundation for all UI features.",
			"reasoning": "TUI implementation is complex due to the need for responsive layouts, state management, and cross-terminal compatibility. The framework must support all future UI features, requiring careful architecture. Breaking into 5 subtasks allows proper separation of concerns between framework setup, layout, navigation, state, and theming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "OpenShift Client Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Client library integration and connection pool setup with HTTP/2, 2) Authentication system supporting multiple methods (kubeconfig, tokens, OAuth), 3) API abstraction layer with rate limiting and retry logic, and 4) Connection monitoring and metrics collection. Ensure proper error handling and version compatibility throughout.",
			"reasoning": "Client integration requires careful handling of authentication, connection management, and API compatibility across OpenShift versions. The complexity comes from supporting multiple auth methods, implementing proper rate limiting, and ensuring reliability. Four subtasks provide good separation between core integration, auth, API layer, and monitoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Resource Listing and Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Core resource model definitions for Kubernetes/OpenShift resources, 2) Resource listing with pagination and caching layer, 3) Filtering, search, and sorting functionality, 4) Real-time updates via watch streams, and 5) Resource operations (describe, logs, delete, restart) with batch support. Ensure efficient handling of large resource sets.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex data management with real-time updates, efficient caching, and multiple operation types. The need for pagination, filtering, and batch operations adds complexity. Five subtasks allow proper separation of models, listing, filtering, real-time updates, and operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Multi-Cluster Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Cluster context manager with switching and persistence, 2) Multi-cluster connection management with status indicators, 3) Parallel resource operations across clusters, and 4) Unified views and cluster comparison features. Focus on maintaining performance with multiple active connections.",
			"reasoning": "Multi-cluster support adds moderate complexity through parallel operations and unified views. The main challenges are connection management, context switching, and maintaining good UX. Four subtasks appropriately separate context management, connections, operations, and views."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Log Streaming and Event Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Core log streaming infrastructure with API watch integration, 2) Log filtering, searching, and highlighting with regex support, 3) Event monitoring and alerting system, and 4) Log aggregation, export, and retention features. Ensure efficient handling of high-volume log streams.",
			"reasoning": "Log streaming is complex due to performance requirements with high-volume data, real-time processing, and advanced filtering. The need for aggregation across pods and event monitoring adds complexity. Four subtasks separate core streaming, filtering, events, and management features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "OpenShift-Specific Resource Support",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) OpenShift resource models (BuildConfigs, ImageStreams, DeploymentConfigs), 2) Operator and subscription management support, 3) Specialized UI views for each resource type, 4) Resource-specific operations (build triggers, rollbacks, tag management), and 5) Resource relationship visualizations and metrics. Include vulnerability tracking for images.",
			"reasoning": "OpenShift-specific resources are complex due to their unique behaviors and operations. Each resource type (builds, images, deployments, operators) has distinct requirements. Five subtasks allow proper handling of core resources, operators, UI specialization, operations, and visualizations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Developer Workflow Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Port forwarding system with automatic tunnel management, 2) Container shell access and exec functionality, 3) File transfer and synchronization features, 4) Resource editing with YAML/JSON validation and hot reload, 5) Development environment wizards and templates, and 6) Debugging support with breakpoint integration. Focus on seamless developer experience.",
			"reasoning": "Developer workflows are highly complex, involving multiple subsystems (networking, file I/O, process management) and requiring seamless integration. Each feature (port forwarding, shell, file transfer, editing, debugging) has unique technical challenges. Six subtasks are needed to properly address all aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: 1) Memory optimization with object pooling and efficient data structures, 2) CPU optimization with goroutine management and concurrency control, 3) Performance monitoring dashboard and metrics collection, and 4) Benchmark suite and continuous performance testing. Target <100MB memory, <5% CPU usage, and <2s startup time.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization requires deep analysis and careful implementation of various techniques. The strict performance targets (memory, CPU, latency) add complexity. Four subtasks appropriately separate memory optimization, CPU optimization, monitoring, and benchmarking efforts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Plugin Architecture and Ecosystem",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Core plugin architecture design with interfaces and lifecycle management, 2) Sandboxed execution environment with security controls, 3) Plugin dependency management and hot-loading support, 4) Plugin marketplace infrastructure with discovery and installation, and 5) Developer documentation and sample plugins. Ensure extensibility without compromising security.",
			"reasoning": "Plugin systems are inherently complex due to security concerns, API stability requirements, and the need for a robust ecosystem. The sandboxing, hot-loading, and marketplace features add significant complexity. Five subtasks properly address architecture, security, management, marketplace, and developer experience."
